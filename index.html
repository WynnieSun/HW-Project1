  <h1>Design Decisions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Our theme is cats. There are cats along the navigation bar, in the daily boxes, and a pawprint by each date.</li>
    <li>We matched the colors from the image of the cat looking out the window to provide a unified color theme.</li>
    <li>We chose fonts that fit with the colors and images.</li>
    <li>We adjusted font sizes to make the home page more readable.</li>
    <li>Hover features also helped readability.</li>
    <li>We created a navigation bar on the left hand side to make the site easier to navigate.</li>
    
  </ul>
